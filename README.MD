# Sorting algorithms

This repository is only for educational purposes. You will find the most used sorting algorithms here implemented in the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/)

##### Complexity nÂ²
- Bubble Sort [DONE]
- Insection Sort [DONE]
- Selection Sort [DONE] 

##### Complexity n log n 
- Merge Sort [DONE]
- Quicksort [DONE]
- Heapsort [TODO]

##### Complexity n
- Counting Sort [DONE]
- Bucket Sort [TODO]
- Radix [TODO]

### Running

Requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) to run.

In a terminal window with the GOPATH environment variable set to the GOPATH you want to work on, launch code.

If you are using Visual Studio Code you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) to configure him.

To execute the algorithms you just need to run the index file in the prompt. 

Example:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

### Tests

You will find the tests in the test folder.

In a terminal window run the command:

```sh
$ go test -v
```
